Web interface for Captain's Log. This is a Rails app that handles all CRUD
operations and calls out to external services for entry processing and
querying.


=== Requirements

- Ruby 2.6.1
- PostgreSQL 10.3


=== Development

    bundle                                # install dependencies
    bundle exec rake db:setup             # setup database
    bundle exec rake test                 # run tests
    bundle exec rake lint                 # run linters

    bundle exec rake test:system          # run e2e tests
    bundle exec rake lint:all             # run all linters

    bundle exec rails s                   # start the web server process
    bundle exec ./bin/delayed_job start   # start the background worker process


=== Database

Captain's Log uses a single database, one that which this application need read
and write access to. The database and schema create by `rake db:setup` is the
one that external services use and require access to as well. These services
should only need read-only access.
