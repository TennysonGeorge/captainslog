![Captain's Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minond/captainslog/master/web/app/assets/images/logo.png)

Captain's Log is an application for logging anything you want. The intent is to
have an application that someone can use to log anything in relatively free
form, but while still being able to extract (or inject) important information
from each log entry and, more importantly, from aggregated logs.

Captain's Log is made up of three separate services: a service for [entry
processing](/tree/master/processor), one for [querying](/tree/master/querier),
and a [web application](/tree/master/web). Code and documentation for each
service can be found in the appropriate directory.
